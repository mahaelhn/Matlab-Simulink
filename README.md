# Matlab-Simulink

Mobile Network : Simulink (models)

Matlab(MATrix LABoratory) is a tool to do numerical computations, display information graphically in 2D and 3D, and solve many other problems in engineering and science. The best way to learn what Matlab can do is to work through some examples at the computer. In this tutorial, we give getting start and some examples.
